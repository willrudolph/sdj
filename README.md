# SDJ Project Page
Self-Described JSON

SDJ files are a subset of standard .json/text files.
Unlike standard JSON, sdj files internalize a self-description of the data which it contains.
By separating the description from the data; this allows customizable, consistent, and validatable structure.  
With a single JSON schema, SDJ files can be used to describe, store, retrieve, and
transmit nearly any type of data.

This is currently a project in active development. This location will detail 
overall project information, details, goals, and status. It will also be used
to store provide example SDJ files.

Initial Development Goals:
- finalization and implementation of initial sdj-esm 0.0.7 (complete!)
- deploy and make available sdj-esm as public/unscoped on npmjs (complete! [v0.3.2 available](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sdj-esm))
- parallel sdj-editor development (in-progress)
- increase and expand test coverage (in-progress)
- provide a variety of sdj example files (in-progress)
- sync & correspond sdj-editor development w/sdj-esm (in-progress)
- finalize sdj-edit and lock down (future)
- build SDJ libraries for other languages (after JS/TS is stable and complete)
